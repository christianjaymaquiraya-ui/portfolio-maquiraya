Answer: Check power supply connection, test power outlet, verify PSU switch, check internal connections, listen for POST beeps, test with minimal hardware, check for component failures systematically. 2. Explain the difference between hardware and software? Answer: Hardware is physical components (motherboard, RAM, CPU), Software is programs and operating systems that run on hardware. They work together - hardware provides capability, software provides functionality. 3. How do you handle stress when you don't know the answer? Answer: I'm honest about knowledge gaps, leverage available resources including AI tools and documentation, ask for guidance when needed, and commit to learning. I don't pretend to know what I don't but show willingness to learn quickly.",
